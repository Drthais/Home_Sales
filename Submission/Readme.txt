Home Sales Data Analysis with SparkSQL

What is this project?
This project uses Apache Spark to analyze home sales data. We use SparkSQL to answer questions about the data and look at ways to make the analysis faster.

What data is used?
The project uses a file called home_sales_revised.csv. It has information like:

Sale date

Price

Number of bedrooms/bathrooms

Square footage

Year built

What tools are used?
Apache Spark: A tool for working with big data.

SparkSQL: A part of Spark that lets us use SQL to query data.

Python: The programming language used.

Jupyter Notebook: The place where the code is written and run.

What does the project do?
Loads Data: Reads the home sales data into Spark.

Creates Table: Makes the data available for SQL queries.

Analyzes Data: Uses SQL queries to find things like average home prices.

Speeds things up:

Caching: Stores data in memory for faster access.

Partitioning: Divides data into smaller parts.

Compares Speed: Checks how much caching and partitioning improve query speed.

Cleans up: Removes the cached data.

What are the results?
The project shows how SparkSQL can be used to analyze data.  It also shows that:

Caching makes queries much faster by storing data in memory.

Partitioning can also speed up queries, especially when filtering data.

Partitioning: How it helps or hurts
Partitioning divides data into smaller parts based on column values (like "year built").

How Partitioning Helps
Faster Queries: Spark only reads the partitions it needs.

Less Data Shuffling: Spark moves less data around when combining or grouping data.

Better Organization: Data is stored in a more organized way.

How Partitioning Hurts
More Overhead: Managing many partitions can use up resources.

Uneven Data: Some partitions might be much larger than others, slowing things down.

Bad Choice: Partitioning the wrong columns might not help and can even slow things down.

Best Ways to Partition
Choose the Right Columns: Use columns you often use to filter data.

Avoid Uneven Data: Try to keep partitions the same size.

Think about your Queries: Partition data in a way that matches how you query it.

In this project, partitioning by "year built" makes sense if you often look at home sales by year.  If you usually look at other things (like number of bedrooms), partitioning by those things might be better.
